The system_server process in the core Android package has an exported broadcast receiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate the taking of a screenshot and have the resulting screenshot be written to external storage. The taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user; the device has a screen animation as the screenshot is taken and there is a notification indicating that a screenshot occurred. If the attacking app also requests the EXPAND_STATUS_BAR permission, it can wake the device up using certain techniques and expand the status bar to take a screenshot of the user's notifications even if the device has an active screen lock. The notifications may contain sensitive data such as text messages used in two-factor authentication. The system_server process that provides this capability cannot be disabled, as it is part of the Android framework. The notification can be removed by a local Denial of Service (DoS) attack to reboot the device.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:leagoo:p1_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:leagoo:p1_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:leagoo:p1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:leagoo:p1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:leagoo:p1_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
