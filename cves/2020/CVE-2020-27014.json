Tainted data from the attacker is used and copied to temporary files. The target host does insecure temporary file creation.","related_weakness":["367","61","662","667","689"],"solutions":"Use safe libraries when creating temporary files. For instance the standard library function mkstemp can be used to safely create temporary files. For shell scripts, the system utility mktemp does the same thing. Access to the directories should be restricted as to prevent attackers from manipulating the files. Denying access to a file can prevent an attacker from replacing that file with a link to a sensitive file. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to files. Ensure good compartmentalization in the system to provide protected areas that can be trusted.","summary":"This attack leverages the use of symbolic links (Symlinks) in order to write to sensitive files. An attacker can create a Symlink link to a target file not otherwise accessible to her. When the privileged program tries to create a temporary file with the same name as the Symlink link, it will actually write to the target file pointed to by the attackers' Symlink link. If the attacker can insert malicious content in the temporary file she will be writing to the sensitive file by using the Symlink. The race occurs because the system checks if the temporary file exists, then creates the file. The attacker would typically create the Symlink during the interval between the check and the creation of the temporary file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes. The adversary is able to modify resource. A race condition exists while accessing a resource.","related_weakness":["362","366","367","368","370","662","663","665","691"],"solutions":"Use safe libraries to access resources such as files. Be aware that improper use of access function calls such as chown(), tempfile(), chmod(), etc. can cause a race condition. Use synchronization to control the flow of execution. Use static analysis tools to find race conditions. Pay attention to concurrency problems related to the access of resources.","summary":"This attack targets a race condition occurring between the time of check (state) for a resource and the time of use of a resource. A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2020-11-05T16:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-367","id":"CVE-2020-27014","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-11-05T16:22:00","references":["https://helpcenter.trendmicro.com/en-us/article/TMKA-09974","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-1285/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://helpcenter.trendmicro.com/en-us/article/TMKA-09974","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-1285/"]},"summary":"Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\n\\n\\r\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:antivirus:2020:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:antivirus:2020:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:antivirus:2020:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*"]}
