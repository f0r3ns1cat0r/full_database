It was noticed that by placing neutral characters such as \"/\", \"?\" in filepath causes the URL to be flipped and displayed from Right To Left. However, in order for the URL to be spoofed the URL must begin with an IP address followed by neutral characters as omnibox considers IP address to be combination of punctuation and numbers and since LTR (Left To Right) direction is not properly enforced, this causes the entire URL to be treated and rendered from RTL (Right To Left). However, it doesn't have be an IP address, what matters is that first strong character (generally, alphabetic character) in the URL must be an RTL character.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:opera:opera_browser:37.0.2192.105088:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:opera:opera_browser:37.0.2192.105088:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:opera:opera_browser:37.0.2192.105088:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"]}
