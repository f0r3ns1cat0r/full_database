# CVE Data Storage

A CVE, or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a publicly disclosed vulnerability or security issue that can exist in software or hardware products. CVEs are assigned a unique identifier that helps security professionals and vendors track and manage the vulnerability. The CVE system is managed by the MITRE Corporation, which is a non-profit organization that focuses on technology research and development.

The purpose of CVE is to provide a standard naming convention for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This naming convention helps security researchers, vendors, and organizations to identify and track vulnerabilities across different systems and platforms. CVEs are assigned to vulnerabilities and security issues that have been assigned a CVE identifier by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) or by a researcher or vendor.

When a security issue or vulnerability is discovered, it is important to disclose it responsibly to the vendor or organization responsible for the affected product. Once the issue has been confirmed and fixed, the vendor or organization can request a CVE identifier for the vulnerability. This identifier is then added to the CVE database and made publicly available to help others identify and address the issue.

The CVE system is widely used across the security industry and is an important tool for identifying and managing vulnerabilities. By using a standardized naming convention and database, security professionals can more easily collaborate and share information about vulnerabilities. This helps to improve overall security and reduce the risk of cyberattacks.
