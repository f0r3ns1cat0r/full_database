When the 'bgp-error-tolerance' feature &#xe2;&#x80;" designed to help mitigate remote session resets from malformed path attributes &#xe2;&#x80;" is enabled, a BGP UPDATE containing a specifically crafted set of transitive attributes can cause the RPD routing process to crash and restart. Devices with BGP enabled that do not have 'bgp-error-tolerance' configured are not vulnerable to this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 13.3 prior to 13.3R10-S2; 14.1 prior to 14.1R8-S4, 14.1R9; 14.1X50 prior to 14.1X50-D185; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D45, 14.1X53-D50; 14.2 prior to 14.2R7-S7, 14.2R8; 15.1 prior to 15.1F5-S8, 15.1F6-S7, 15.1R5-S6, 15.1R6-S2, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D64, 15.1X53-D70; 16.1 prior to 16.1R3-S4, 16.1R4-S3, 16.1R5; 16.2 prior to 16.2R1-S5, 16.2R2; 17.1 prior to 17.1R1-S3, 17.1R2; 17.2 prior to 17.2R1-S2, 17.2R2; 17.2X75 prior to 17.2X75-D50.
