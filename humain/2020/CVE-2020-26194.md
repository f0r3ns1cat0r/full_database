Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.1.2 and 8.2.2 contain an Incorrect Permission Assignment for a Critical Resource vulnerability. This may allow a non-admin user with either ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE or ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH privileges to exploit the vulnerability, leading to compromised cryptographic operations. Note: no non-admin users or roles have these privileges by default.
