# CVE-2023-32698

nFPM is an alternative to fpm. The file permissions on the checked-in files were not maintained. Hence, when nfpm packaged 
the files (without extra config for enforcing it’s own permissions) files could go out with bad permissions (chmod 666 or 777). Anyone using nfpm for creating packages without checking/setting file permissions before packaging could result in bad permissions for files/folders.
