lib/Driver/sql.php in Turba 2 (turba2) Contact Manager H3 2.1.x before 2.1.7 and 2.2.x before 2.2-RC3, as used in products such as Horde Groupware before 1.0.4 and Horde Groupware Webmail Edition before 1.0.5, does not properly check access rights, which allows remote authenticated users to modify address data via a modified object_id parameter to edit.php, as demonstrated by modifying a personal address book entry when there is write access to a shared address book.
