# CVE-2008-2809

- Published: 2008-07-08T23:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:44:00

Mozilla 1.9 M8 and earlier, Mozilla Firefox 2 before 2.0.0.15, SeaMonkey 1.1.5 and other versions before 1.1.10, Netscape 9.0, and other Mozilla-based web browsers, when a user accepts an SSL server certificate on the basis of the CN domain name in the DN field, regard the certificate as also accepted for all domain names in subjectAltName:dNSName fields, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into accepting an invalid certificate for a spoofed web site.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
